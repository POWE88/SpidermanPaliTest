# README
# SpidermandPaliTest
This project was given to me as an interview take-home demo/exam. This program is designed to help Spiderman recue Mary Jane from the evil PALINDROMICON. In order to defeat the PALINDROMICON, Spiderman must produce a certain number of palindromes. 

To help Spiderman in his heroic efforts, this program uses an English wordlist (check out the words.txt file) to generate the number of palindromes specified by the user (Spiderman in this case). 

# How to use? 
This is a basic ruby program that can be run form the terminal useing the following steps:
1. download both the words.txt and pali.rb file
2. place both into the same directory
3. open up terminal and navigate to the direcotry where you placed the files
3. in terminal, run the .rb file (for example, type `ruby pali.rb`)
